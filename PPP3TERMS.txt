// //used for commenting
function //a block of code that can be repeated inside a program
output //the resulting piece of something from a program
compiler // piece of software that "compile" your source code into object file
error // something that wrong or the program arent supposed to do maybe a logic error, compile error , run-time error or link-time error
linker // program that link object code and produce executable
executable //ready to run object code because the resulting machien code is complete and doesnt need any dependencies anymore
object code // machine code results from source code
comment // piece of textx that the compiler doesnt see and compile and its for human eye
import // code for including a module
library // source code that has many definitions and declaration of functions, macro , variable and/or structures
module //same with library's header file but with also the implementation details
main() // a function that the program starts from
C++ // an exmaple of language that use for writing source code
IDE // software that eases and speeds up development of code
source code // human-readable file that can be turned into machine code
statement //
#include // a directive that will expand into a header file ,essentially making the file appear at that point and thus making the definitions,declaration etc be available
<< // an operator that print the right hand into the left hand stream
header file // file for storing declaration definitions and etc but not the implementation details
program // 
compile-time // a time interval where the programs compiling(or rather being compiled)
cout // the output streams for output of C++
std // standard library for C++ that contains many functions , macro , data structure etc
command line // a terminal in software that mimic older physical terminal in the early days of computer 
bug // error of a program whether its logic error , compile-time error or the other
debugging // process of which to find and fix bug whether by checking the source code or using tools like GDB for helping the debuggin process (maybe see the resulting assembly or something)
